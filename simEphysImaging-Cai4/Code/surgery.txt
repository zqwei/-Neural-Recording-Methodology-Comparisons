Window surgery 

-----------------

Transgenic mouse lines, GP4.3 and GP5.17, were used to study spike-calcium relationship of calcium indicators, GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f respectively. 3-5 week-old male mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3% for induction, 1-2% during surgery). A circular craniotomy (3 mm of diameter) was made on the primary visual cortex (2.7 mm lateral, and 0.2 mm anterior to lambda). The craniotomy was first covered with agarose (1.5%), and a half circular glass coverslip (hand-cut from round glass coverslips, Warner Instruments, 3.5 mm, #1 thickness) was put on top of the agarose before it hardened. Coverslips were cemented to the skull to reduce motion artifact. A small, wet GELFOAM (Pfizer) was placed on the agarose to prevent it from drying. A custom titanium head post was fixed to the skull using black dental cement (Contemporary Ortho-jet). After dental cement hardened completely, simultaneous imaging and patching experiments were started. During recording, animals were kept warm on a homeothermic blanket system (Harvard Apparatus) and kept calm and light anesthesia using chlorphorthixene (20-40 ul at 0.33 mg/ml, i.m.) and 0.5% isoflurane.
